Welcome to meatpy's documentation!
==================================

The Market Empirical Analysis Toolbox for Python (MeatPy) is a Python module aimed at researchers studying high-frequency market data feeds, focusing on full limit order book data. 
MeatPy aims to provide a set of standard, user-friendly open-source tools to lower the bar to entry into advanced empirical market microstructure research. 

MeatPy's latest documentation is available at `<https://meatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and the source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/vgreg/MeatPy>`_.

MeatPy is a work in progress, and a lot remains to be done before we reach version 1.0. As of the current version, MeatPy only supports Nasdaq ITCH 5.0 files.

Installation
------------

You can install MeatPy using ``pip install meatpy``.
